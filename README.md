# SpiltGate
Fully automated and undetectable splitgate anti-recoil utility. 

Using https://github.com/Sadmeme/rzctl to bypass any virtual input detection. 

Currently only works if you have: 
1. razer synapse fully installed
2. A 3440x1440 monitor

Although should be easily modifiable to work for any other setup. If you dont have synapse and are worried about detection, consider using AutoHotInterception in your implementation.

If you are a splitgate dev and you find this, please leave a star before you blacklist this modification :)
