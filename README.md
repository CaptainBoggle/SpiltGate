# SpiltGate
Fully automated and undetectable splitgate anti-recoil hack. 

Using https://github.com/Sadmeme/rzctl to bypass any virtual input detection. 

Currently only works if you have: 
1. A razer mouse and razer synapse fully installed
2. A 3440x1440 ultrawide monitor

Although should be easily modifiable to work for any other setup. If you dont have a razer mouse and are worried about detection, consider using AutoHotInterception in your implementation.
